# I Really Move On

This repositories hosts my entry for [GamedevJS 2021 jam][gamedevjs].
The topic is Mirror. If you deduplicate it, you can form the anagram IRMO.

When I think on mirrors, I think on reflection of light. So this what this
entry is about: you have a light source, that emits light. Your goal is to
find the right angle to make it cross the target.
